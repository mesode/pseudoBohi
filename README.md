# pseudoBohi
Intendng to build the Bohikor App. The idea is that when the app is launched a welcome screen is displayed which prompts the user to click a button which will lead them to the sign up/log in page. So far the welcome screen is ok, but I wanted the content to display in the saef area so I am working on the styling for that. Sinc using SafeAreaView for react native android android is the same as View.
